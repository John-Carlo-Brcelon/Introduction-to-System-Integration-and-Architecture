System Integration and Architecture from what I've researched involves combining different computer systems, software applications, or subsystems into a single, coordinated system. It focuses on making sure that all these components were interconnected to one another, forming or creating a functional system. 

Through these ideas and concepts involving System Integration and Architecture, I expect this course to reveal fundamental knowledge that I can carry on throughout my time as a BSIT student, and also on my professional career.

Moreover, I'm also expecting this course to give me a lot of headaches and maybe a little more caffeine intake, for I know that although it may help me learn significant lessons especially as a future IT person, it would also be open a doors for some knowledge that are hard to grasp. But I won't take it too much in my heart because I also expect that our Instructor will guide us ever step of the way.
